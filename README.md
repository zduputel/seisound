# seisound
Simple python scripts to listen to seismograms in mono or stereo.

Output files are in the [WAV format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV). 
To read these files, I recommend [Sonic Visualiser](https://www.sonicvisualiser.org), 
an open source application for viewing and analysing audio files.

## Dependencies
- python2 or python3
- python modules: scipy, wave, datetime, struct

## How to run
There are two scripts:
- seisound_mono.py: Reads a single SAC file, speed it up and write it in a mono WAV file. This script should be used as follows:
```
python seisound_mono.py sacfile wavfile speedup
```
where `sacfile` is the input SAC file name, `wavfile` is the output WAV audio file and `speedup` is the speedup factor.
- seisound_stereo.py: Reads two synchronized SAC files, speed them up and write it a stereo WAV file. To run this script:
```
python seisound_stereo.py sacfile1 sacfile2 wavfile speedup
```
where `sacfile1` and `sacfile2` are the input SAC files, `wavfile` is the output WAV audio file and `speedup` is the speedup factor.

## Examples
Two examples are provided:
- `examples/sumatra_earthquake_2004`: the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake recorded at two stations (`CHTO` in thailand and `BFO` in germany). 
  You can just run `get_audio_stero.sh` to generate an audio file with a speedup factor of 3000.
- `examples/PitonDeLaFournaise_eruption_June2014`: The June 2014 eruption at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano (La RÃ©union island) recorded at two seismological stations maintained by the volcano observatory (OVPF). Data can be downloaded using the `obspy` script `get_OVPF_data.py`. 
  Once data is downloaded, you can generate an audio file using `get_audio_stero.sh` (speedup factor = 300).
